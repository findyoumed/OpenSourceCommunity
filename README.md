## What is this?

UltimateCommunity is an open-source, self-hostable community platform with 11 built-in modules — forums, ideas, events, courses, webinars, knowledge base, chat, members, notifications, and AI-powered social intelligence — all running on Cloudflare's global edge network. Deploy it on Cloudflare Pages + Workers with your own Supabase project and own your data completely. Released under a non-commercial open-source license: free to use, fork, and self-host.

## Quick Start (Local Dev)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, pnpm 9+, Docker, Supabase CLI

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonJLevesque/OpenSourceCommunity.git
cd OpenSourceCommunity
pnpm install

# Copy env examples
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env

# Start local Supabase
npx supabase start

# Push DB schema + seed
pnpm db:push && pnpm db:seed

# Start dev servers
pnpm dev

# Open http://localhost:3001 → /setup to create your community
```

The dev command starts all apps in parallel via Turborepo:

| App | URL |
|-----|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3001 |
| API | http://localhost:8787 |
| Supabase Studio | http://localhost:54323 |

Visit `/setup` to create your community and admin account on first run.

Once set up, the admin panel lives at `/admin` — it includes settings pages for all 8 modules (Forums, Ideas, Events, Webinars, Knowledge Base, Courses, Chat, and Social Intelligence). Social Intelligence is restricted to org admins only.

2. **Connect Cloudflare Pages** — link your fork to a new Pages project, set the build command to `pnpm --filter web build` and output directory to `apps/web/.vercel/output/static`
3. **Set environment variables** in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below)
4. **Deploy the API worker** — configure `apps/api/wrangler.toml` with your domain and run `pnpm --filter @osc/api run deploy`
